Memories of dreams fade quickly, and visualizing them is nearly impossible—until now. DreamSync lets you describe a dream out loud and instantly transforms it into a short cinematic scene with AI-generated visuals, optional voiceover, and captions. By fusing speech-to-text (or typed input), LLM narrative shaping, text-to-video (or fallback slideshow), and audio assembly, we preserve dreams as immersive experiences to rewatch and share. Beyond personal use, DreamSync helps therapists, artists, and storytellers turn fleeting thoughts into vivid worlds—blurring the line between imagination and reality.
